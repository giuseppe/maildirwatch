** Maildirwatch **

A simple program that watches a collection of Maildirs[1] for incoming
messages.  It works only on GNU/Linux as it uses inotify to monitor
changes on the file system.

* Integration with Emacs

New messages can be quickly notified in Emacs by adding these few
lines to your .emacs file:

;; begin of maildirwatch

(load "/path/to/maildirwatch.el")

;; Path to the maildir executable
(setq maildirwatch-path "/path/to/maildirwatch")

;; List of Maildirs to watch for incoming messages
(maildirwatch-watch '("~/Maildir"))

;; end of maildirwatch
